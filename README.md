# HalfHeight

An extension to `UI.NCurses` for drawing half-height console graphics.

By drawing a Unicode [Upper Half Block](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2580) character (â–€) with different foreground and background colors, one can simulate drawing two rows of a 2D grid of colors in one row, achieving grid cells that take up half a console row alongside regular console text.

There's a [brief writeup](https://askham.ai/2020/11/26/half-height-console-graphics.html) on my blog.

The main caveat is that one is now restricted to 15 unique colors: `UI.NCurses` usually lets you define 255 custom foreground/background combinations, but now we might have any two colors appear as our foreground/background.

## Usage Example

The above Mandelbrot example can be seen in `app/Main.hs`.
